The idea is to use them in the \"When...\" part of a Homey flow and then use a \"Set relative dim-level\" card in the \"Then...\" part of the flow. One flow to increase with e.g. +10%, and one flow to decrease with e.g. -10%.\n\nNOTE 2: For \"Stationary switch as scene selector\", the primary scene is recalled in the \"On\" state and the secondary scene is recalled in the \"Off\" state. For \"Push button as scene selector\", the primary scene is recalled with short press and the secondary scene is recalled with long press. The inputs will not control the outputs and no Flow cards will be triggered by the inputs.\n"
